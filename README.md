## Rise of the German Hegemony

This is a project based on the popular Hearts of Iron 4 mod Kaiserreich which explores a world where the Central Powers won World War I. I wrote a story based on an alternate World War II in this universe and used a website as a medium to tell this story.

The website is created with NextJS and React, styled using Tailwind CSS, and is hosted on Vercel. The website uses Neon as its database to store its content and pulls content using PostgreSQL in places.

There are multiple articles covering the main events of this alternate World War II and its various peace treaties.

Angel's Craft Corner was the second big project I was working on at Civiconnect, this website was for a crafts business that specializes in holiday themed decorations.

I developed the shop page's functionalities and visual components, this included the dropdown menus in both PC and mobile view and the shop page's pagination.

I also developed the individual shop item's webpages as well, this includes the colour picker, image display carousel, colour option picker, and the add to cart function that utilizes localstorage.

On the backend, I created the data structure that held the information for an item for the website as well as the collections needed for the shop page.

## Sus Contracting

Sus Contracting was my first big project when I was working at Civiconnect, I was placed in a team of 4 to help produce a new website for Sus Contracting Inc.

I helped with the prototype design using Figma.

I developed and implemented various components on the website such as the footer, the carousels on the landing page, and created animations such as the initial animation upon entering the site, search bars, animations for the About Page, and skeletons on the Blog page.

I helped design the database being used to hold content for the website on Strapi.

I also helped with testing the website using tools like Lighthouse, which told us which parts of the website needed improvement based on Performace, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO.
